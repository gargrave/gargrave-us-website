# [DEPRECATED] 

This is the old version of my personal website, and it is no longer maintained. The current version is [here](https://github.com/gargrave/gargrave-website).

# My Website

This is just the source for my personal website. Probably not a great deal of super interesting stuff to see here, as it's effectively just a fancier version of my resume.

If you want to see it live, you can view in all of its glory at [https://gargrave.net](https://gargrave.net). Like I said, it's pretty simple.
