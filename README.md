# [WIP] Gargrave Website

This is the website I am currently working on as a portfolio/resume site for myself. In its current state, it is very minimal, and not yet ready to be deployed.

I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for the base with [Material UI (alpha)](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-alpha) for the UI layer.

More updates to come as I have time to make more progress.
