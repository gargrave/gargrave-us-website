# [WIP] Website: gargrave.us

This is the website I am currently working on as a portfolio/resume site for myself. In its current state, it is more or less ready for public consumption, although I do have a few tweaks left to make. Since I am not a designer, I am keeping the design as simple and clean as possible--lest I should end up with something completely ridiculous looking.

You can view the live site [here](https://gargrave.us). 

Dev-wise, I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for the base with [Material UI (alpha)](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-alpha) for the UI layer.

## TODO

These are my short-term todos (i.e. when I have time within the next couple of days):

- [ ] Create a favicon to replace the default React one
- [ ] Do something with the header area. Anything.
