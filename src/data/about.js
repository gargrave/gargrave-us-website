  Otherwise, if you're _not_ looking for me, you will probably have more fun watching [cat videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cat%20videos).
  Go ahead, I won't be offended.`,

  The information below is basically everything you will find on my resume, albeit a bit expanded in some places.
  If you need to **contact** me, please refer to my resume ([download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/94otn62reycxas3/GabeHargrave-Resume.pdf?dl=0))
