  Hi there! My name is **Gabe Hargrave**, and I am web developer. If you are looking for a treasure trove of information about me, you have come to the right place.
  Otherwise, if you're _not_ looking for me, you will probably have more fun watching [cat videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cat%20videos).
  Go ahead, I won't be offended.

  The information below is basically everything you will find on my resume, albeit a bit expanded in some places.
  If you need to **contact** me, please refer to my resume ([download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t03k3a77fevv2b9/GabeHargrave-Resume.pdf?dl=0))
  or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabe-hargrave-264322133/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gargrave).

  As for the site itself, I built it with React, using the excellent [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as a seed, 
  and it is hosted on an Ubuntu/Nginx Droplet at Digital Ocean. If you feel so inclined, you can peruse the full source for the site
  [here](https://github.com/gargrave/gargrave-us-website).
