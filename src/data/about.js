  Hi there! My name is **Gabe Hargrave**, and I am a software developer. While my primary focus is front-end web development,
  I get excited about all aspects of software engineering, and I am always pushing myself to learn and apply new things.`,
  `
  The information below is basically everything you will find on my resume, albeit a bit expanded in some places.
  If you need to **contact** me, please refer to my resume ([download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/94otn62reycxas3/GabeHargrave-Resume.pdf?dl=0))
  or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabe-hargrave-264322133/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gargrave).`,
  `
  **One quick note**: This site itself was initially built in summer 2017 with React, and I opted to use the Material UI 
  framework. In hindsight, I have realized that I would have been much better off just building all of my own CSS, 
  but I haven't really had the time to start over from scratch, so here we are. One of these days, I will get around to
  cleaning it up fully, but until then I am kind of married to this hefty framework.`
