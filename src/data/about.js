  Hi there! My name is **Gabe Hargrave**, and I am web developer. If you are looking for a lot of information about me, you have come to the right place.
  If you're _not_ looking for me, you will probably have more fun watching [cat videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cat%20videos).
  Go ahead, I won't be offended.

  If you need to contact me, please find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabe-hargrave-264322133/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/gargrave).

  This site itself was built with React, using the excellent [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as a seed, 
  and it is hosted on an Ubuntu/Nginx Droplet at Digital Ocean. If you feel so inclined, you can peruse the full source for the site
  [here](https://github.com/gargrave/gargrave-us-website).
